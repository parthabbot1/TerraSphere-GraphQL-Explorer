# TerraSphere GraphQL Explorer

Interactive table to show country data and filter the data based on country code. The table queries the data using Graph ql.

It also includes pagination and toggle to switch designs of the table. The toggle turns on the interactive mode

I have also used some Moon.io components(by yolo) as well. 

I have not used any other external component or Ui library and the code is written with pure HTML CSS styles.(No 3rd party Ui library has been used except for Moon.io)
